# Discogs Data Manipulation Tools

A command line tool suite for checking, cleaning, and converting
[Discogs Data Dumps](https://data.discogs.com/) into JSON format.

Currently in an extremely alpha state. See
[discogs-xml2db](https://github.com/philipmat/discogs-xml2db) for a
more mature toolkit.

### Why?

To scratch some personal itches and engage in some personal
development. Generally want to focus on the minimum viable kit needed
to reliably convert Discogs data to usable JSON in an idiomatic UNIX
style.
